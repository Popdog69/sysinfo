# sysinfo
One-liner system info script for Linux and various Unix flavors.

This script was originally written by David Rudie in 2002-2005. For a time after that, with David's permission, I added support for a number of new systems and added a few new features.

It's now been quite a number of years since this was actively maintained beyond simple fixes to allow it to run on newer kernels, but I still get quite a few requests for it. For that reason, I am adding it to git now so that it's easily accessible and others can contribute if they would like to.
